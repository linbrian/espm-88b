 
 Module II: Extinction of Megafauna
 ===================================


### Example/possible data sources

- `data/megafaunal-extinction-data.csv` Data from [Sandom et al (2014)](http://dx.doi.org/10.1098/rspb.2013.3254)

A/B testing: are extinction probabilities higher in areas which experienced arrival of modern homo sapiens than areas that co-evolved with them?
