The course will meet once a week for 2 hour sessions.  This course
is structured around four modules that will give students a chance to
explore key questions in our study of ecology and the environment by
applying the techniques they learn to real world data.  Each module will
span three weeks of instruction and follow the same format:

in the first week of the module the instructor will introduce the module,
scientific context, and questions surrounding the data that students
will be exploring.  Students will be assigned reading material providing
further background.

In the second week of each module, students will work through an
interactive tutorial with the instructor to access, parse and explore
basic questions in the data set. Students will be assigned a homework
activity to complete alone or in pairs that further extends this
exploration to apply the methods covered in the foundation to answer
key questions about the phenomena in question.

In the third week of the module, students will share the results of
their investigation, and practice critiquing the approach, analysis and
conclusions of their peers.

## Final projects 

Students will conduct and original analysis alone or in pairs that focuses on applying methods covered in the foundation course to formulate and answer their own questions regarding any one of the data sets we have covered.  While students will be encouraged to start thinking about their final projects early in the course, this class session will be used for hands-on work on the projects in consultation with the instructor and peers.  

The goal of the final project is to integrate the concepts and techniques introduced throughout the semester to demonstrate how they work together in one analysis context. Students will need to respond thoughtfully to the questions based on the work that they do in each section while expressing their knowledge of key concepts.
