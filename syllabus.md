The course will meet once a week for 2 hour sessions.  This course
is structured around four modules that will give students a chance to
explore key questions in our study of ecology and the environment by
applying the techniques they learn to real world data.  Each module will
span three weeks of instruction and follow the same format:

* in the first week of the module the instructor will introduce the
module, scientific context, and questions surrounding the data that
students will be exploring.  Students will be assigned reading material
providing further background.

* In the second week, students will work through an interactive tutorial
with the instructor to access, parse and explore basic questions in the
data set. Students will be assigned a homework activity to complete alone
or in pairs that further extends this exploration to apply the methods
covered in the foundation to answer key questions about the phenomena
in question.

* In the third week, students will share the results of their
investigation, and practice critiquing the approach, analysis and
conclusions of their peers.

### Final projects 

Students will conduct and original analysis alone or in pairs that focuses on applying methods covered in the foundation course to formulate and answer their own questions regarding any one of the data sets we have covered.  While students will be encouraged to start thinking about their final projects early in the course, this class session will be used for hands-on work on the projects in consultation with the instructor and peers.  

The goal of the final project is to integrate the concepts and techniques introduced throughout the semester to demonstrate how they work together in one analysis context. Students will need to respond thoughtfully to the questions based on the work that they do in each section while expressing their knowledge of key concepts.
