  Apply methods and understanding from the Data Science Foundations course
  to real-world ecological and environmental data sets. In a hands-on
  approach, you will learn about issues in the natural world while also
  developing skills for working with real-world data encountered in all
  areas of data science.

## Overview

Many of the greatest challenges we face today come from understanding
and interacting with the natural world:  from global climate change
to the sudden collapse of fisheries and forests, from the spread of
disease and invasive species to the unknown wealth of medical, cultural,
and technological value we derive from nature.  Advances in satellites
and micro-sensors, computation, informatics and the Internet have made
available unprecedented amounts of data about the natural world, and
with it, new challenges of sifting, processing and synthesizing large
and diverse sources of information.

In this course, students will apply methods and understanding they gain
in the Foundations course to real-world ecological and environmental data
sets. Through this hands-on approach, students will learn more about
issues in the natural world while also developing the practical skills
for working with heterogeneous real-world data encountered in all areas
of data science.

In this course students will apply methods they learn in the Foundations
course to explore, pose, and answer key questions using relevant data
from the Ecological and Environmental Sciences.  In so doing, students
will confront the complexity and messiness of real world data, and learn
and practice essential tools for capturing, manipulating and sharing data.
We will further take advantage of the small class setting provided by the
connector to emphasize good workflow and coding practice, collaboration,
and help students better master and apply the techniques covered in
the Foundation.
